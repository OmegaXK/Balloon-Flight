# Balloon-Flight
Files for my recreation of Balloon Flight from the "Coding Games In Python" book by DK, written with Pygame instead of Pygame Zero. I also made a bunch of small modifications to make the game a lot more addictive and fun.

# Additional Notes
Here are the modifications I made:
1. You can press the "escape" key at any time to exit the program
2. There is a caption that says Balloon Flight at the top
3. There is now game over text
4. The text displaying your high scores is bigger
5. There is now text at the bottom of the game over screen that tells you to press "q" to quit or "r" to restart
6. You can now press "q" to quit on the game over screen
7. You can now press "r" on the game over screen to restart the game for easier replayability
8. The trees and houses cannot spawn inside of each other
9. The game is harder because the collision is better
10. The game is easier to modify because the code is very readable
11. Many more behind-the-scenes programming modifications that make the game run a lot smoother

# Credits
General idea, image files, and file handling all came from the book, "Coding Games In Python" by DK.
Shoutouts to "Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python" and "Making Games With Python And Pygame" books by Al Sweigart for getting me into Pygame
